# leaderboard
In this activity, I will set up a JavaScript project for my Leaderboard list app, using webpack and ES6 features, particularly modules. I will develop a first working version of the app following a wireframe, but without styling. My main focus will be on functionality. In subsequent activities, I will consume the API using JS async and await
